I is involves for to find the difference of the rational expression and then sub the difference difference.
I solve the rational equation, I need to get the denominctions on multiplying both sides by the least common multipleinator of
The this case, the least common denominator is $ $r+4$, so that appears the denom terminator that
So I canly both sides by $r+4$ to get $r+2-3r-17)(2r^2+14r+28$.
Now I can a quadratic equation, which I can solve by fact all to the side and factoring.
I gettract $2r^2$15r$28$ from both sides and get $r^2-32r-11=0$.
I factor factor this $- common $ and a $rr^2+18r+45)=0$.
I I can factor out quadratic and and get $-(r+55)(r+3)=0$.
This solutions are $r=-15$ and $r=-3$. but I factor can be zero.
Now find the positive difference of the solutions, I just to subtract the smaller one from the larger one. get the absolute value.
I smaller solution is $-r=-35$, and the larger solution is $r=-3$.
So the positive difference is $-1-(-15)|=|12|=12$.

To solve for $x$, I need to getate it on one side of the equation. getting the operations.
I, I can squarely both sides by $\ conjinator ofsqrt{3(x-1)}$ to get the radical.
This gives me $\sqrt{5x}= = 2 \sqrt{3(x-1)}$.
Next, I can square both sides to get rid of the square roots.
This gives me $5x = 4(x(x-1)$.
Simanding the right sidehand side, I get $5x = 12x - 12$.
Subtracting $12x$ from both sides, I get $7x = 12$.
Dividing both sides by $-7$, I get $x = \\frac{12}{7}$.

I can know that there are 6 stoo s at each tab e, so s = 6t.

This gives me \[\frac{\sqrt[4]{n} - \sqrt[4]{n + 1}}{(\sqrt{n} + \sqrt{n + 1})(\sqrt[4]{n} + \sqrt[4]{n + 1})(\sqrt[4]{n} - \sqrt[4]{n + 1})}.\] Now I can cancel out the \(\sqrt[4]{n} + \sqrt[4]{n + 1}\) terms in the denominator and get \[\frac{\sqrt[4]{n} - \sqrt[4]{n + 1}}{(\sqrt{n} + \sqrt{n + 1})(\sqrt{n} - \sqrt{n + 1})}.\] Next, I notice that the denominator is a difference of squares, so I can factor it further as \[(\sqrt{n} + \sqrt{n + 1})(\sqrt{n} - \sqrt{n + 1}) = \sqrt{n}^2 - \sqrt{n + 1}^2 = n - (n + 1) = -1.\] This means that the summand simplifies to \[-\frac{\sqrt[4]{n} - \sqrt[4]{n + 1}}{1} = \sqrt[4]{n + 1} - \sqrt[4]{n}.\] Now I can rewrite the sum as \[\sum_{n = 1}^{9999} \sqrt[4]{n + 1} - \sqrt[4]{n}.\] This looks like a telescoping series, where most of the terms cancel out. To see this, I can write out the first few and the last few terms of the sum: \[(\sqrt[4]{2} - \sqrt[4]{1}) + (\sqrt[4]{3} - \sqrt[4]{2}) + (\sqrt[4]{4} - \sqrt[4]{3}) + \cdots + (\sqrt[4]{10000} - \sqrt[4]{9999}).\] I notice that the first term in each parenthesis cancels out with the second term in the previous parenthesis, except for the very first and the very last terms. Therefore, the sum is equal to the very last term minus the very first term: \[\sqrt[4]{10000} - \sqrt[4]{1}.\] This is easy to compute, since \(\sqrt[4]{10000} = \sqrt[4]{10^4} = 10\) and \(\sqrt[4]{1} = 1\).
